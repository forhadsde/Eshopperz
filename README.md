## Logging Overview

This project utilizes the Serilog logging library for efficient event tracking and error recording. Logging plays a vital role in monitoring application behavior, identifying issues, and maintaining insights.

- Configuration: Logging setup occurs during the application's configuration phase, specifying where log information should be stored or displayed.
- Log Levels: Serilog categorizes logs into levels like Error, Warning, Information, and Debug based on severity.
- Error Handling: Logging strategically captures exceptions and errors, aiding in debugging and issue resolution.
- Informational Logging: Significant events, such as role creation, updates, deletions, or user role assignments, are logged to track application state changes.
- Request Logging: In specific actions, the incoming request body is logged for auditing and understanding processed data.
- Exception Logging: Exceptions are logged with details, facilitating quick identification of errors and their origin.
- Structured Logging: Serilog supports structured logging, enhancing log event readability and filtering with key-value pairs.
- Exception Handling: Logging within try-catch blocks ensures caught exceptions are recorded, preventing unexpected application termination.
